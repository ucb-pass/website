			<p><strong>Tell Us About Your Position</strong></p>
			<p>As YM Coordinator, I closely work with the Galing Bata After-School Program & Staff and YM mentors. I recruit, train, coordinate, and overall, bond with mentors to establish a trusting and healthy working relationship, and encourage mentors to take ownership of the program. Every other week, I facilitate an Education and Ethnic Studies Field Studies Approved seminar that aims to explore issues concerning minorities in education, current education policies, and bilingual education.</p>
			<p>Fall/Spring Programming:</p>
			<p>1. Monthly Carnivals</p>
			<p>2. Fall/Spring YM Retreat, Mentor Bonding Activities [MBAs], & Banquet</p>
			<p>3. Spring Shadow Day(s): Mentees take a field trip to Cal.</p>
			<p>My goal is to ultimately share the PASSION of YM with others. It is not just about going out to mentor at least once a week. We do what we do for the COMMUNITY. I want foster a tight-knit community with the GB staff, mentees, fellow mentors, and the YM team. In the end, I hope mentors realize the importance of mentorship and strive to become the ideal mentor as an Ate or Kuya (older sister or brother, respectively).
</p>
			<p><strong>What part of PASS Hystory or Pilipin@ Hystory would you like to observe or experience?</strong></p>
			<p>I want to explore Pilipin@ Hystory through learning and doing more Traditional/Folk dances. As for PASS Hystory, I want to experience a SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION year with PASS 28 that archives everything--hystory that was lost in the past, rediscovered in the present, and will be made in the future.</p>
			<p><strong>Fun Facts</strong></p>
			<p>1. Contrary to popular belief, my favorite color is NOT yellow. I just happen to have a lot of yellow items.<p>
			<p>2. I've easily baked over 300 cookies for Galing Bata since Fall 2011.</p>
			<p>3. I've been reverse bungee jumping in Singapore.</p>
