			<p>The Internal Affairs component serves as the 'back-bone' of our organization. It originally held 5 different positions with all having the responsibility of keeping PASS running smoothly and efficiently. Currently, the Public Relations position is unfilled and its position responsibilities have been shared amongst the rest of the internal component.</p>
		<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~pass/staff/recruitment.html"><h2>Recruitment</h2></a>
			<p>The recruitment component of PASS seeks to promote awareness of access to higher education. PASS aims to spread knowledge and share experiences by encouraging our future leaders to pursue higher education.</p>
		<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~pass/staff/retention.html"><h2>Retention</h2></a>
			<p>PASS serves as a resource to the Pilipino campus population by providing academic resources and social services. Working closely with the Cesar Chavez Learning Center, we strive to build a community of academically, politically and socially retained individuals. </p>

		 <p><strong>Tell Us About Your Position</strong><br><br>As Executive Director, it's my responsibility to provide support for staff and interns with their respective programming, along with watching out for the welfare of the entire organization and our communities. As the acting Gender and Sexuality Awareness Coordinator, along with my interns, we are focusing on continuing the work to build stronger spaces to support the experience and political issues of queer Pilipin@s and Filipina womyn, through biyuti and the Womyn's Space. We are hoping to recreate a community and provide a safe space for these "minorities within a minority" to dialogue. In addition, we are continuing to work closely with the Gender Equity Resource Center (GenEq) and Queer Alliance Resource Center (QARC) to help establish the first queer recruitment and retention center within the bridges Multicultural Resource Center. Along with the External Relations Coordinator, I am excited to begin a new program to encourage alumni to continuously support our work. We will be inviting Pilipin@ alumni back to Berkeley for PASS Alumni Weekend. This event intends to provide encouragement for alumni to network with current students, provide mentorship, provide an update of the current state of the community and public education, and hopefully partner with them in providing financial support for our various programs.
				<p><strong>What part of PASS Hystory or Pilipin@ Hystory would you like to observe or experience?</strong></p>
				<p>I would like to observe the creation of biyuti and the Gender & Sexuality Awareness Coordinator position. What was happening at the time? Why did PASS see the need to provide support for these students?</p>
				<p><strong>Fun facts</strong></p>
				<p>Want to know what I am thinking? Refer to my facial expressions and my left eyebrow.</p>
