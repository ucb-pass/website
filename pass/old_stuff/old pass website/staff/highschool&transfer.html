			<p><strong>Tell Us About Your Position</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Justine:</strong></p>
			<p>The major programming under the Outreach component includes Bay Area Outreach during the fall, Central California Outreach during winter break (the week prior to the beginning of the spring semester), and Southern California Outreach during spring break. Besides general outreach programming, we also provide feedback and advice for personal statements in the fall and appeals in the spring.</p>
			<p>The Outreach component aims to reach out to underserved, underprivileged, and underresourced high schools and community colleges and provide them support in their path to higher education, with particular attention to Pilipin@ presence in higher education. We also want to empower students who are already in institutions of higher education (particularly within the Pilipin@ community at Cal) to inspire and help those who are still on their path to higher education. Generally, we want to increase the accessibility of higher education.</p>
			<p><strong>Trixy:</strong></p>
			<p>Fall Programming: Bay Area Outreach, Central Cal Outreach and Personal Statement workshops</p>
			<p>Position Goals:</p>
			<p>1. I hope to make Bay Area outreaches more accessible to the community (in terms of publicizing and contacting volunteers).
			<p>2. I also hope to make the internal aspect of the outreaches (contactinging schools, planning, booking school, and maintaining databases) more organized and structured.<p>
			<p>3. I want to create strong relationships with the schools that we outreach to for future outreaches.</p>
			<p>4. Making outreach fun and instilling a PASSion within our outreachers.</p>
			<p>5. I also want to bring what was lost in the past (how things were structured and organized) and utilize the pluses and deltas of the past to help guide us in our work this year.<p>
			<p>6. I really want to make this ours - very Justine and Trixy-fied. Lolz, every year is very unique, and I would love to put our own little Justine and Trixy twist to this year.<p>
			<p><strong>What part of PASS Hystory or Pilipin@ Hystory would you like to observe or experience?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Justine:</strong></p>
			<p>I would definitely want to experience the moment when PASS was founded. I just really want to see what they felt and what they thought.</p>
			<p><stong>Trixy:</strong></p>
			<p>I would like to see outreach at its earliest form to see what has changed in the community and in higher education.</p>
			<p><strong>Fun Facts</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Justine:<strong></p>
			<p>1. I have two sisters that are at least 17 years younger than me.</p>
			<p>2. I made Dobby costume and wore it to the midnight premiere of Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows Part 2, then I cried literally buckets of tears after watching it.</p>
			<p>3. I gave up Pride & Prejudice (anything and everything about it) for Lent a couple years ago. It was the most excruciating time of my life. </p>
			<p><strong>Trixy:<strong></p>
			<p>1. I'm left handed when I write and draw, but I'm right handed when it comes to playing sports like tennis.</p>
			<p>2. I'm a big zombie apocalypse movie fan. Yeah, you know who is going to survive when it happens.</p>
			<p>3. I love, love, love target. If I had to choose one store to be in during a zombie apocalypse, you already know where I'm going, that or Costco.</p>
