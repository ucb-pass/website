			<p><strong>Tell Us About Your Position</strong></p>
			<p>So we are holding down a triple threat position, which is the High School and Transfer Outreach Coordinator and SHADOW Coordinator. We coordinate programming that brings current UC Berkeley students and alumni to various High Schools and Community Colleges to spread the knowledge and process of how to apply and enter Higher Education or Transfer. We prepare presentations to classrooms and after school programs, trying to connect with these students and offer our services as a resource for them all throughout High School and beyond. We also coordinate outreach trips to Central California in the Winter and Southern California in the Spring.</p>
			<p>On the SHADOW side of things, we operate programming that brings High School and Community College students to UC Berkeley to shadow and be mentored by current UC Berkeley Students, offering them the opportunity to ask questions about college, learn more about Higher Education, and live life in the shoes of a current Berkeley Student. We hold SHADOW Events during the Day as well as in a span of a Weekend, inviting whole schools to come experience Berkeley with us. We even hold MYPASS Shadows which allows individual students to schedule when they want to come to UC Berkeley for a One-on-One Shadow experience with someone matched up according to interests both in academic and social goals.</p>
			<p><strong>What is your most memorable experience in PASS?</strong></p>
			<p>My most memorable experience in PASS is the Gender and Sexuality Retreat. I think i really learned to embrace my gender and come to a realization how powerful it is to be a woman. Plus, it was really neat to finally have a clear understanding on stereotypes for other genders. <strong>Lorraine</strong></p>
			<p>My most memorable experience in PASS was working with the students from 2010 FED SHADOW Weekend. It was the first major event I was able to take part of producing and managing as a SHADOW intern under 2010 SHADOW Coordinator Angelo Cabal. It wasn't just about us, the Berkeley Students, inspiring and enlightening the students, the students inspired us as well. Being able to make these connections with these students was an mazing experience. I came into Berkeley having no siblings, but those students soon became my new Little Brothers and Sisters. We all stayed connected, sending them information on SATs and other ways to prepare yourself to College. But it's more than just helping them get into Higher Education. It's about being there as mentors and as friends that really captured my heart in the work we do here in PASS. Seeing them inspired to reach Higher Education is what we strive for and what has inspired me to continue doing the work that we do. <strong>Wayne</strong></p>
